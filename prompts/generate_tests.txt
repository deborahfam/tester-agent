You are provided with the description of a programming problem, input and output information, constraints, examples and a candidate implementation of the `solve` function in Python.
Your task is to produce a list of exhaustive and varied test cases to validate the correctness of `solve`.

Problem:
{statement}

Input format:
{input}

Output format:
{output}

Constraints:
{constraints}

Examples:
{examples}

Candidate code:
{code}

Generate up to {max_tests} distinct test cases.  Each case must be an object with the keys:
 - "input": a list with the arguments that the `solve` function will receive.
 - "expected": the value that `solve(*input)` should return if it is correct.
 - "type": optional label indicating whether the case is basic, edge or adversarial.

Return exclusively the list of cases in valid JSON format (do not include explanations or code blocks), for example:

[
  {"input": [1, 2, 3], "expected": 6, "type": "basic"},
  {"input": [], "expected": 0, "type": "edge"}
]
